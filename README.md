# 🧠 Synthetic Editorial

**An AI-powered editorial system that searches for source materials, analyzes content, and generates articles in the style of a defined editorial persona.**

This project builds upon the Contributte WebApp Skeleton structure and adds an AI layer that allows you to:

- define a topic (e.g., "Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart"),
- automatically gather high-quality online sources,
- and generate well-sourced articles in a specific writing style (based on an editorial persona).

---

## 🔧 Tech stack

- PHP 8.1+, Nette Framework
- Doctrine ORM, Nettrine
- AI integration (OpenAI / LLM ready)
- Docker-ready environment
- Automation via cron / CLI
- Structure based on [contributte/webapp-skeleton](https://github.com/contributte/webapp-skeleton)

## 🚀 Project Goal

Simplify the creation of expert articles by combining:
- artificial intelligence,
- publicly available materials,
- and a defined editorial “voice.”

This project can be used as a foundation for:
- internal editorial tools,
- content idea generation,
